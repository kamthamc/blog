Hi, this is my first travel blog post. My Friends and me have spent almost a week in YellowStone National Park.

I am kind of a guy who doesn't like anything easily.

We have visited old Faithful, Biscuit Basin, Mystics falls, Grand Prismatic Spring, Norris Geyser Basin,
Roaring Mountain, Mammoth Hot Springs, Petrified Tree, Lamar Valley, Hayden Valley, Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone,
West Thumb. We went for Rafting, Zip lining. We have planned few more but couldn't make it all.

I have enjoyed the White Water Rafting, but wasn't as good as expected but good enough
because of wrong timing for rafting.

I liked the zip lining, I have never done a zip lining with adventures before. It was both entertaining and exhausting.

I did feel like most of the geyser's are same but at different locations.

### Bysons
We encountered a lot of bysons on the road in Hayden Valley and this is much better than Lamar Valley.
